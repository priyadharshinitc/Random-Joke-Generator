# Random Joke Generator

## Description
The **Random Joke Generator** is a fun and interactive website where users can view jokes based on a specific category. Users can enter a category (e.g., `animal`, `travel`, etc.) in the input field, and upon clicking the button, a joke from the selected category is displayed. The application uses the Chuck Norris API to fetch jokes.

If a specific category is not available, an error message will be displayed:

```
No jokes for category "<category>" found. Available lists are animal, career, celebrity, dev, explicit, fashion, food, history, money, movie, music, political, religion, science, sport, travel.
```

## Features
- **Dynamic Joke Fetching**: Fetch jokes based on user-input categories.

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for use on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
